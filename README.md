# elevator-clj

Summer vacation, 2018. While driving around Oregon with my family and listening to Rich Hickey's talk, [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc), I thought, why not try this approach on a small system?

Immediately, the small system that came to mind was an elevator simulator. I can't find the original source on the idea to design an elevator system as a "code kata," but it was probably something Bob Martin suggested in a book.

Fun things about designing an elevator system:

* Simple enough to hack together on vacation
* Complex enough to be interesting
* Obversable in real life

(Another kata I considered was designing a seat reservation system, but I've already done that for real.)

Anyway, it was a fun exercise. I spent free time over a couple of days writing and drawing various rules and edge-cases that an elevator would need to handle. I waited longer than felt natural to start coding -- basically, as long as I could possibly wait before my notes started turning into code.

And when I did write code, I chose Clojure, in honor of Rich Hickey.

Now if only I could finish it. :sweat-smile:
